These are class notes for a survival analyis workshop at Karolinska Institute,
presented in Sept 2023.  The primary software tool is the R survival package,
and most data sets are from the package.

data: extra data sets
papers: useful papers
*.Rmd and .Rmw: code for the slides and examples

population.pdf is a short description of population marginal means that was
written as an internal memo for one project, but I thought it reads well enough
to be useful.
